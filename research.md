Although I have not yet published in any of the top UTD 24 or FT 50 journals, I would like to share my research progress and contributions to the community. Here are works catergorized by my research agenda.

### Research Agenda 1: Token-based Platforms

Token-based platforms are esential for the development of the digital asset economy in the complex Web 3.0 market. My research aims to provide better governance and regulation of token-based platforms.

      <summary>Abstract</summary>
      <p>While the environmental impact has become an important IT governance agenda in recent years, it is unclear whether its disclosure 
      is valued by token holders of platforms based on blockchain IT infrastructure and how these platforms react to changing public awareness 
      of their environmental impacts. We consider Elon Musk’s 2021 announcement that Tesla would suspend accepting Bitcoin as payment because 
      of Bitcoin mining's environmental impact as a shock that dramatically increases awareness of Bitcoin mining's environmental impacts. 
      We find that, subsequent to the shock, infrastructure platforms which have larger environmental impacts than application platforms, are 
      more likely to disclose environmental impact information than application platforms and that their token market values grow at a slower 
      rate, consistent with the increased awareness spills over to other token-based platforms. Furthermore, whereas pre-shock environmental 
      impact disclosure by infrastructure platforms reduces token market value growth rates, post-shock disclosure has the opposite effect, 
      consistent with green-costing and green-enhancing, respectively.</p>

### Research Agenda 2: Regulated Digital Currencies

The designs of regulated digital currencies, like Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), are complex and involve a trade-off between system features. My research aims to provide solutions to CBDC implementation and their adoptions of consumers and merchants.

      <!-- **Abstract**: The e-HKD Pilot Programme is a key component of the HKMA's three-rail approach in paving the way for a possible implementation of a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC). The pilot programme enables HKMA's collaboration with the industry to examine innovative use cases and maximise Hong Kong's readiness for a potential e-HKD. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC) was one of the institutions selected to participate. Collaborating with the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), HSBC sought to explore possible e-HKD every-day payment use cases, focusing on programmability as a value-add feature of digital currency as well as payment rail efficiency. HSBC and HKUST constructed a one-week pilot on the HKUST campus, which included 148 students and 5 merchants. -->

      <!-- **Abstract**: HSBC's solution analyses 12 problem statements in this Global CBDC Challenge and uses 15 dimensions (e.g. business secrecy, latency, scalability, accessibility, etc.) to measure a retail CBDC system. Their analysis and research found that consensus algorithms and related operating models are key components of CBDC design for central banks. With this in mind, HSBC built an evaluation platform to provide central banks with consensus algorithm recommendations and operating model options. -->

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
    <p>Software code quality is a construct with three dimensions: maintainability, reliability, and functionality. Although many firms have incorporated code quality metrics in their operations, evaluating these metrics still lacks consistent standards. We categorized distinct metrics into two types: 1) monotonic metrics that consistently influence code quality; and 2) non-monotonic metrics that lack a consistent relationship with code quality. To consistently evaluate them, we proposed a distribution-based method to get metric scores. Our empirical analysis includes 36,460 high-quality open-source software (OSS) repositories and their raw metrics from SonarQube and CK. The evaluated scores demonstrate great explainability on software adoption. Our work contributes to the multi-dimensional construct of code quality and its metric measurements, which provides practical implications for consistent measurements on both monotonic and non-monotonic metrics.</p>

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    <p>We propose a UTXO-based sharding method to achieve horizontal scalability in a token-based system, including stablecoin. The critical challenge of the current sharding method is that introducing extra cross-shard transactions significantly impacts transaction latency. Previous solutions use account-based sharding to improve transaction volume, increasing latency. We propose a new method that improves transaction throughput linearly while keeping latency low by reducing cross-shard transactions. We were able to verify our solution through experiments.</p>
