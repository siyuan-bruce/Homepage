_The goal of behavioral-science research is truth. The goal of design-science research is utility. --- MIS Quarterly, 2004_

While I have not yet published in any of the top UTD 24 or FT 50 journals, I am eager to showcase my dedication to research and my ability to produce high-quality scholarly contributions. 

### Research Agenda 1: Token-based Platforms

Token-based platforms are esential for the development of the digital asset economy in the complex Web 3.0 market. My research aims to provide better governance and regulation of token-based platforms.

      **Abstract**: While environmental impact has become an important corporate governance agenda in recent years, it is unclear whether this is valued by users of token-based platforms and how these platforms react to changing perceptions towards their environmental impacts. This paper examines how the change in community perceptions towards environmental impacts affects token-based platforms’ disclosures and growth. Using Elon Musk’s announcement that Tesla suspended vehicle purchases using Bitcoin due to its environmental impact as a shock that increases the community’s awareness of the negative impacts on the environment because of mining, we find that infrastructure platforms as compared with application platforms are more likely to disclose environmental impact information and their platform growth rates decrease more after the perception change. Furthermore, infrastructure platforms’ pre-change environmental disclosure led to a decline in growth rates, whereas their post-change disclosure demonstrates the opposite effect, consistent with green-costing and green-enhancing effects, respectively.

      **Abstract**: FinTech and RegTech integration is essential for developing regulated digital currency (RDC) systems that meet performance and regulatory requirements. This paper presents a solution to address scalability and regulatory challenges in RDC systems. We first use an Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO)-based sharding method to improve scalability and maintain low latency by minimizing cross-shard transactions. The result shows a linear transaction throughput increase with the number of shards, while consistently maintaining low latency. However, UTXO-based sharding also complicates know-your-customer (KYC) regulations because of the frequent onboarding of users on new shards. We show zero-knowledge proofs seamlessly integrate with UTXO sharding to simplify customer onboarding. This research extends the FinTech and RegTech literature, delivering practical implications for the implementation and management of RDC systems.

       **Abstract**: We propose a Central Bank Digital Currency Evaluation and Verification (CEV) Framework for recommending and verifying technical solutions in the central bank digital currency (CBDC) system. We demonstrate two sub-frameworks: an evaluation sub-framework that provides consensus algorithm and operating architecture solutions and a verification sub-framework that validates the proposed solutions. Our framework offers a universal CBDC solution that is compatible with different national economic and regulatory regimes. The evaluation sub-framework generates customized solutions by splitting the consensus algorithms into several components and analyzing their impacts on CBDC systems. CBDC design involves a trade-off between system features - the consensus algorithm cannot achieve all system features simultaneously. However, we also improve the operating architectures to compensate for the weak system features. The verification sub-framework helps verify our proposed solution through empirical experiments and formal proof. Our framework offers CBDC designers the flexibility to iteratively tune the trade-off between CBDC system features for the desired solution. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a framework to recommend and verify CBDC technical solutions.

      **Abstract**: The e-HKD Pilot Programme is a key component of the HKMA's three-rail approach in paving the way for a possible implementation of a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC). The pilot programme enables HKMA's collaboration with the industry to examine innovative use cases and maximise Hong Kong's readiness for a potential e-HKD. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC) was one of the institutions selected to participate. Collaborating with the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), HSBC sought to explore possible e-HKD every-day payment use cases, focusing on programmability as a value-add feature of digital currency as well as payment rail efficiency. HSBC and HKUST constructed a one-week pilot on the HKUST campus, which included 148 students and 5 merchants.

      **Abstract**: HSBC's solution analyses 12 problem statements in this Global CBDC Challenge and uses 15 dimensions (e.g. business secrecy, latency, scalability, accessibility, etc.) to measure a retail CBDC system. Their analysis and research found that consensus algorithms and related operating models are key components of CBDC design for central banks. With this in mind, HSBC built an evaluation platform to provide central banks with consensus algorithm recommendations and operating model options.

      **Abstract**: Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize problem-solving by significantly improving computational complexity. However, the sophisticated nature of quantum knowledge and circuit design presents challenges for business practitioners. In this study, we introduce FinQMC, a quantum Monte Carlo framework designed to transform classical Monte Carlo algorithms into quantum ones. Our framework proposes the key principle of treating quantum states as the distributions of financial variables. To validate the efficiency and applicability of FinQMC, we conducted two experiments: option pricing and portfolio selection. The results obtained demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of our approach. FinQMC simplifies the complex world of quantum computing and offers a more efficient solution to a wide range of business challenges compared to classical Monte Carlo methods. Practically, our study is the first to apply the quantum Monte Carlo method in the context of portfolio selection.

      **Abstract**: The cryptocurrency market is a complex and rapidly evolving financial landscape in which understanding the inter- and intra-asset dependencies among key financial variables, such as return and liquidity, is crucial. In this study, we analyze daily return and liquidity data for six major cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Binance Coin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin, spanning the period from June 3, 2020, to November 30, 2022. Liquidity is estimated using three low-frequency proxies: the Amihud ratio, the Abdi and Ranaldo (AR) estimator, and the Corwin and Schultz (CS) estimator. To account for autoregressive and persistent effects, we apply the ARIMA-GARCH model and subsequently utilize the copula method to examine the interdependent relationships among the return and liquidity of the six cryptocurrencies. Our analysis reveals strong cross-asset lower-tail dependence in return and significant cross-asset upper-tail dependence in illiquidity measures, with more pronounced dependence observed in specific cryptocurrency pairs, primarily involving Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. We also observe that returns tend to be higher when liquidity is lower in the cryptocurrency market. Our findings have significant implications for portfolio diversification, asset allocation, risk management, and trading strategy development for investors and traders, as well as regulatory policy-making for regulators. In conclusion, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the cryptocurrency marketplace and can help inform investment decision-making and regulatory policies in this emerging financial domain.

Acceptance Rate: 21.47%._ [[Paper]](/paper/QRS_preprint.pdf) [[Slides]](/paper/Slides_Code_Quality_Distribution.pdf) 

    **Abstract**: Software code quality is a construct with three dimensions: maintainability, reliability, and functionality. Although many firms have incorporated code quality metrics in their operations, evaluating these metrics still lacks consistent standards. We categorized distinct metrics into two types: 1) monotonic metrics that consistently influence code quality; and 2) non-monotonic metrics that lack a consistent relationship with code quality. To consistently evaluate them, we proposed a distribution-based method to get metric scores. Our empirical analysis includes 36,460 high-quality open-source software (OSS) repositories and their raw metrics from SonarQube and CK. The evaluated scores demonstrate great explainability on software adoption. Our work contributes to the multi-dimensional construct of code quality and its metric measurements, which provides practical implications for consistent measurements on both monotonic and non-monotonic metrics.

      **Abstract**: We propose a UTXO-based sharding method to achieve horizontal scalability in a token-based system, including stablecoin. The critical challenge of the current sharding method is that introducing extra cross-shard transactions significantly impacts transaction latency. Previous solutions use account-based sharding to improve transaction volume, increasing latency. We propose a new method that improves transaction throughput linearly while keeping latency low by reducing cross-shard transactions. We were able to verify our solution through experiments.
