_The goal of behavioral-science research is truth. The goal of design-science research is utility. --- MIS Quarterly, 2004_

Although I have not yet published in any of the top UTD 24 or FT 50 journals, I would like to share my research progress and contributions to the community. Here are works catergorized by my research agenda.

### Research Agenda 1: Token-based Platforms

Token-based platforms are esential for the development of the digital asset economy in the complex Web 3.0 market. My research aims to provide better governance and regulation of token-based platforms.

"Do Users of Blockchain IT Infrastructure Value Environmental Sustainability? Evidence from Environmental Impacts Disclosures". Working paper. [[Paper]](/paper/SSRN_token_Feb9.pdf) [[Slides]](/paper/Slides_Green_Token_based_Platform.pdf) 

      **Abstract**: While the environmental impact has become an important IT governance agenda in recent years, it is unclear whether its disclosure is valued by token holders of platforms based on blockchain IT infrastructure and how these platforms react to changing public awareness of their environmental impacts. We consider Elon Musk’s 2021 announcement that Tesla would suspend accepting Bitcoin as payment because of Bitcoin mining's environmental impact as a shock that dramatically increases awareness of Bitcoin mining's environmental impacts. We find that, subsequent to the shock, infrastructure platforms which have larger environmental impacts than application platforms, are more likely to disclose environmental impact information than application platforms and that their token market values grow at a slower rate, consistent with the increased awareness spills over to other token-based platforms. Furthermore, whereas pre-shock environmental impact disclosure by infrastructure platforms reduces token market value growth rates, post-shock disclosure has the opposite effect, consistent with green-costing and green-enhancing, respectively.

### Research Agenda 2: Regulated Digital Currencies

The designs of regulated digital currencies, like Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), are complex and involve a trade-off between system features. My research aims to provide solutions to CBDC implementation and their adoptions of consumers and merchants.

[[Summary]](https://www.about.hsbc.com.hk/-/media/hong-kong/en/news-and-media/hypothetical-e-hkd-phase-1-pilot-factsheet-en.pdf) [[Hong Kong Monetary Authority Report]](https://www.hkma.gov.hk/media/eng/doc/key-information/press-release/2023/20231030e3a1.pdf).
  
      **Abstract**: The e-HKD Pilot Programme is a key component of the HKMA's three-rail approach in paving the way for a possible implementation of a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC). The pilot programme enables HKMA's collaboration with the industry to examine innovative use cases and maximise Hong Kong's readiness for a potential e-HKD. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC) was one of the institutions selected to participate. Collaborating with the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), HSBC sought to explore possible e-HKD every-day payment use cases, focusing on programmability as a value-add feature of digital currency as well as payment rail efficiency. HSBC and HKUST constructed a one-week pilot on the HKUST campus, which included 148 students and 5 merchants.

      **Abstract**: HSBC's solution analyses 12 problem statements in this Global CBDC Challenge and uses 15 dimensions (e.g. business secrecy, latency, scalability, accessibility, etc.) to measure a retail CBDC system. Their analysis and research found that consensus algorithms and related operating models are key components of CBDC design for central banks. With this in mind, HSBC built an evaluation platform to provide central banks with consensus algorithm recommendations and operating model options.

      **Abstract**: Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize problem-solving by significantly improving computational complexity. However, the sophisticated nature of quantum knowledge and circuit design presents challenges for business practitioners. In this study, we introduce FinQMC, a quantum Monte Carlo framework designed to transform classical Monte Carlo algorithms into quantum ones. Our framework proposes the key principle of treating quantum states as the distributions of financial variables. To validate the efficiency and applicability of FinQMC, we conducted two experiments: option pricing and portfolio selection. The results obtained demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of our approach. FinQMC simplifies the complex world of quantum computing and offers a more efficient solution to a wide range of business challenges compared to classical Monte Carlo methods. Practically, our study is the first to apply the quantum Monte Carlo method in the context of portfolio selection.

      <!-- **Abstract**: The cryptocurrency market is a complex and rapidly evolving financial landscape in which understanding the inter- and intra-asset dependencies among key financial variables, such as return and liquidity, is crucial. In this study, we analyze daily return and liquidity data for six major cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Binance Coin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin, spanning the period from June 3, 2020, to November 30, 2022. Liquidity is estimated using three low-frequency proxies: the Amihud ratio, the Abdi and Ranaldo (AR) estimator, and the Corwin and Schultz (CS) estimator. To account for autoregressive and persistent effects, we apply the ARIMA-GARCH model and subsequently utilize the copula method to examine the interdependent relationships among the return and liquidity of the six cryptocurrencies. Our analysis reveals strong cross-asset lower-tail dependence in return and significant cross-asset upper-tail dependence in illiquidity measures, with more pronounced dependence observed in specific cryptocurrency pairs, primarily involving Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. We also observe that returns tend to be higher when liquidity is lower in the cryptocurrency market. Our findings have significant implications for portfolio diversification, asset allocation, risk management, and trading strategy development for investors and traders, as well as regulatory policy-making for regulators. In conclusion, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the cryptocurrency marketplace and can help inform investment decision-making and regulatory policies in this emerging financial domain. -->

Xia (2023). “Software Code Quality Measurement: Implications from Metric Distributions”. 23rd IEEE International Conference on Software Quality, Reliability, and Security, Chiang Mai, Thailand. **(QRS 2023)**. _Short paper with oral presentaiton.

    **Abstract**: Software code quality is a construct with three dimensions: maintainability, reliability, and functionality. Although many firms have incorporated code quality metrics in their operations, evaluating these metrics still lacks consistent standards. We categorized distinct metrics into two types: 1) monotonic metrics that consistently influence code quality; and 2) non-monotonic metrics that lack a consistent relationship with code quality. To consistently evaluate them, we proposed a distribution-based method to get metric scores. Our empirical analysis includes 36,460 high-quality open-source software (OSS) repositories and their raw metrics from SonarQube and CK. The evaluated scores demonstrate great explainability on software adoption. Our work contributes to the multi-dimensional construct of code quality and its metric measurements, which provides practical implications for consistent measurements on both monotonic and non-monotonic metrics.

      **Abstract**: We propose a UTXO-based sharding method to achieve horizontal scalability in a token-based system, including stablecoin. The critical challenge of the current sharding method is that introducing extra cross-shard transactions significantly impacts transaction latency. Previous solutions use account-based sharding to improve transaction volume, increasing latency. We propose a new method that improves transaction throughput linearly while keeping latency low by reducing cross-shard transactions. We were able to verify our solution through experiments.
