In this note, I will summarize the basic concepts of blockchain. I will also introduce some of the most popular blockchain protocols, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Hyperledger. The notes are based on my understanding of the blockchain, and I will try to make it as simple as possible. If you find any mistakes, please let me know. The notes are still in progress, and expected to be completed before 2024.
