In the serene quiet of a starlit sky, the brightest stars often capture our gaze with their subtle yet profound brilliance. This celestial metaphor aptly describes my academic philosophy: "Less is more." It is a belief that has shaped my journey through the complex and evolving landscape of research, especially within the realms of blockchain technology and digital currencies.

My voyage into the world of research began somewhat u nexpectedly during my undergraduate studies. Under the mentorship of Dr. Yong Xia, I embarked on a challenging yet rewarding journey that tested my resilience and fostered significant growth. This journey was marked by early hurdles, but the persistence paid off when I was honored with a prestigious China National Scholarship. More crucially, I mastered the art of distilling complex technical terminologies and theories into concise, insightful sentences—a skill that would define my academic output.

The realm of blockchain fascinated me early on, presenting a fertile ground for innovative research. During a formative internship at HSBC, I delved into the design of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) across over 80 countries. This exploration uncovered a tapestry of unique national preferences and technical requirements for CBDC implementations. Inspired by these findings, I proposed a bespoke framework for CBDC design that meticulously balanced performance, privacy, and security considerations. Though initially criticized for its narrative structure at a top-tier conference, with relentless refinement, this framework later won the Global CBDC Challenge award by the Singapore Financial Monetary Authority and found its way into a reputable academic journal.

My industry experience at HSBC was not just about learning the ropes; it was about tying them together to form stronger ties between theoretical research and practical application. I spearheaded the design of a token-based sharding method that significantly enhanced CBDC system performance. The real-world efficacy of this method was tested on a blockchain cluster of over 100 servers on AWS, showcasing impressive results in scalability and transaction latency.

The intellectual rigors of my journey led me to the halls of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) for an MPhil/PhD in Information Systems. It was here, during a seminar course, that Professor Kai-lung Hui posed a simple yet profound question: "Why are you pursuing a PhD?" I found myself grappling with the question, only to realize that at the core of all scholarly endeavor was the pursuit to "uncover the truth." This revelation became a guiding light for my subsequent research.  

At HKUST, under the guidance of Professors Kar Yan Tam and Allen Huang, I explored the environmental impacts of blockchain technologies. This work was particularly timely, considering the growing importance of sustainability in corporate governance. Our research, catalyzed by Elon Musk’s announcement to suspend Tesla purchases using Bitcoin, investigated how changes in community perceptions affected environmental disclosures and growth patterns among token-based platforms. This led to the conceptualization of the "Unified Ledger" technical whitepaper, which we presented to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.

In collaboration with Professors Kohei Kawaguchi, and Marc DORDAL CARRERAS, I also embarked on a CBDC project that involved a pioneering field experiment at our campus. The study aimed to clarify common misconceptions between e-HKD and e-wallets, highlighting the need for greater public education on the nature of digital currencies as legal tender. 

In reflecting on my leadership and interpersonal skills, I've discovered that the principle of "less is more" has been a guiding light in my approach to collaboration and education, significantly enhancing how I secure research funding and educate. Partnering with Professors Kar Yan Tam and Yingying Li, I successfully secured significant research funding, applying this minimalist approach to create focused, impactful project proposals that succinctly communicate our goals and outcomes, effectively cutting through the complexities of grant applications. Additionally, as a teaching assistant and lab instructor for the ISOM 2020 course, I applied the same principle, distilling complex concepts into clear, manageable insights, which not only aids retention but encourages deeper understanding among students. 

Each chapter of my academic journey, influenced by the "Less is more" philosophy, has been a testament to the power of resilience, growth, and the relentless pursuit of clarity and insight. From the early days of my undergraduate studies to the ongoing research at HKUST, my path has been laden with both challenges and triumphs, shaping me into a scholar capable of making meaningful contributions to both academia and industry. And as I continue to navigate this journey, I remain committed to uncovering truths that, like the brightest stars in the night sky, illuminate our understanding of the complex information systems landscape before us.
