# When Is a Paper Ready for Submission?
As PhD students, we often agonize over the same question: When is a paper “good enough” to submit? It’s a puzzle with no clear answer, but thankfully, my department often invites seasoned editors from top journals to share their wisdom. Over time, I’ve collected two memorable pieces of advice that have stuck with me.

## Story #1: The Boring Research Question
One day, a senior editor from MIS Quarterly (let’s call him CW) shared a humbling story. He’d spent months touring his latest paper, presenting it at over ten top universities in China. At first, he felt optimistic — audiences asked plenty of questions. But then, he noticed something odd: all the questions were about clarifications, not his research question.

That’s when it hit him: My research question just isn’t interesting enough.

He went back to refine it, ensuring it resonated with his audience. Only then did he submit the paper. His story taught me a valuable lesson: if no one is engaging with your research question, it might be time to rethink it.

## Story #2: The Marginal Benefits Rule
Another MIS Quarterly editor, MZ, gave a different perspective:

“When your paper doesn’t deserve another round of revision, it’s time to submit.”

He explained that after a certain point, the marginal benefits of revising — those tiny, incremental improvements — simply aren’t worth the time and effort. At that stage, it’s better to submit and let the reviewers weigh in.

While this advice makes sense in theory, as a junior scholar, it feels tricky to apply. How do we know when we’ve hit that point? Unlike senior researchers, we lack the instincts to judge whether our paper is “good enough” or still needs work.

## What’s the Takeaway?
For me, CW’s advice is more practical. When you present your work and all you get are clarification questions — and no one seems curious about your core research question — that’s a clear signal to revisit the foundation of your paper. On the other hand, MZ’s “marginal benefits” rule feels like something I’ll understand better with experience.

Ultimately, deciding when to submit is less about perfection and more about trusting your instincts — and, sometimes, your audience. And if you’re stuck? Submit it anyway. There’s no better teacher than a reviewer’s feedback (as painful as it might be).

Good luck, and may the reviewer gods be kind!
