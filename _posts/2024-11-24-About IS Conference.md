So, I recently stumbled upon the THIS is Research podcast—my new guilty pleasure as a junior scholar trying to figure out this whole academia thing. One episode in particular caught my attention: ["THE THREE MOST USELESS SLIDES IN CONFERENCE PRESENTATIONS" (4 September 2024)](http://www.janrecker.com/this-is-research-podcast/the-three-most-useless-slides-in-conference-presentations-4-september-2024/
). Intrigued by the title and desperate to not embarrass myself at my next conference, I hit play.

The episode was a revelation. It completely changed how I think about conferences. You see, when I attend IS conferences, I’ve always felt like paper sessions are a bit like polite tea parties—everyone sips their metaphorical tea, nods quietly, and then moves on. Networking, I realized, is the real reason we’re all there. But here’s the kicker: as a presenter, your real job isn’t just to present—it’s to make people curious enough to come talk to you afterward. That’s where the magic happens.

The podcast then hit me with a list of the three most useless slides in conference presentations. Drumroll, please:

- The literature review slide (seriously, no one cares).
- A dense table of regression results (because nothing says “please ignore me” like a spreadsheet on a slide).
- …Wait, I missed the third one. (Clearly, I need to work on my note-taking skills.)

As I was listening, I couldn’t help but laugh at how guilty I was of at least two of these sins. And then I remembered something that Anindya Ghose said when he visited our campus. He emphasized how important it is for junior scholars like me to attend conferences—not just to present, but to learn how to engage with others, interact with speakers, and build relationships. It’s not just about delivering a paper; it’s about becoming part of the conversation.

That advice stuck with me, and the podcast made me realize I’ve been doing conferences all wrong. I’ve been the person who nervously reads from their slides, avoids eye contact, and bolts out of the room before anyone can ask a question. But that’s about to change.

Here’s my new game plan for conferences, inspired by the podcast:

- Submit to PDWs (Professional Development Workshops): These are where the real discussions happen, and I want to be part of them.
- Attend panel discussions: Panels are like intellectual improv—there’s energy, debate, and cool insights you don’t get from regular sessions.
- Talk to speakers after their sessions: This is terrifying, but also where the best networking happens.
- Chat with people in my field: No more lurking in the corner with a cup of coffee—I’m going to introduce myself and talk shop.
- Give a killer presentation: Forget the boring slides. I want to tell a story, spark curiosity, and make people want to come talk to me.

So, with this new strategy in mind, I’m actually excited for my next conference. 

Stay tuned—I’ll let you know how it goes!
