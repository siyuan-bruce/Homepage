Students in the Msc in Data-Driven Modeling program at the Department of Physics, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, are required to complete a supervised project during their study. The following is a list of projects that I have supervised or co-supervised.


## 2023 Fall - 2024 Spring
#### Project Title: The Boundary Condition of Quantum-Inspired Sampling Techniques: A Systematic Review
- Jialiang Xu (Ongoing Msc in Data-Driven Modeling at the Department of Physics, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology)
- Zhenxing Tan (Ongoing Msc in Data-Driven Modeling at the Department of Physics, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology)


## 2022 Fall - 2023 Spring
#### Project Title: Reinforcement Learning for Continuous Control: A Quantum Normalized Advantage Function Approach
- Yaofu Liu (Msc in Data-Driven Modeling at the Department of Physics, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology),
